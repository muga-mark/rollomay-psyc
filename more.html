                    He worked on several approaches which includes Humanistic Psychology, and Existentialism. Humanistic Psychology that focuses on 
                    the capacity for growth and achievement in human beings. May took these ideas a step further as he explored the purpose of anxiety 
                    in human beings, while Existentialism focuses on man's search for meaning and purpose in life. But of all of these approaches, he 
                    focuses on Existentialism which he established. May determined that human beings fear death because we cannot comprehend our own lack 
                    of existence. Rolly May was an American Psychologist who is often referred to as the father of Existential Psychology. He was an in-
                    fluential American Psychologist who helped established a new branch of psychology.
                    <br><br>
                    He came to this approach through personal hardship. As explained, Existentialism deals on man's search for meaing and purpose in life. 
                    May was stricken by tuberculosis, a bacterial lung infection, and was hospitalized for several years. During this illness, May began 
                    to explore the meaning of life in face of death. This curiosity eventually led May to study clinical psychology, and was the recipient 
                    of the first PhD in clinical psychology by Columbia University.
                    <br><br>   
                    May believed that people may lack the courage to face their destiny and while in the process of fleeing from it, they give up much their 
                    freedom. In contrast, healthy people challenge their destiny, cherish their freedom, and live authentically with other people and themselves. 
                    They recognize the inevitability of death and have the courage to live life in the present.

                        <p align= 'justify'>A movement that focused on helping normal persons achieve their full potential through an 
                            eclectic combination of therapeutic methods and disciplines. The movement's values include 
                            tolerance, a basic optimism about human nature, the necessity of honest interpersonal 
                            communication, the importance of living life to the fullest in the "here and now," and a 
                            spirit of experimentation and openness to new experiences. Maslow, together with Rogers, 
                            Rollo May, and Charlotte Buhler, founded the American Association of Humanistic Psychology.
                            Subscribing to a positive, optimistic view of human nature, he popularized the concept of 
                            self-actualization, based on his study of exceptionally successful, rather than exceptionally
                            troubled, people. </p>

                        <br />
                        Selecting a group of "self-actualized" figures from history, including Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865), 
                        Albert Einstein (1879-1955), and Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962), Maslow constructed a list of their 
                        characteristics, some of which later became trademark values of the human potential movement 
                        (acceptance of themselves and others, spontaneity, identification with humanity, democratic values, 
                        creativity). In Maslow's widely popularized hierarchy of motivation, the basic human needs were 
                        arranged at the bottom of a pyramid, with self-actualization at the highest level. Another of Maslow's
                        ideas was the concept of the "peak experience," a transcendent moment of self-actualization 
                        characterized by feelings of joy, wholeness, and fulfillment.</p>

                            <p align= 'justify'>Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York is an independent, 
                                non-denominational, seminary grounded in the Christiantradition,[2] located in New York 
                                City. It is the oldest independent seminary in the United States and has long been known
                                as a bastion of progressive Christian scholarship, with a number of prominent thinkers
                                among its faculty or alumni. It was founded in 1836 by members of the Presbyterian Church
                                in the U.S.A.,[3] but was open to students of all denominations. In 1893, Union rescinded 
                                the right of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to veto faculty appointments, 
                                thus becoming fully independent. In the 20th century, Union became a center of liberal 
                                Christianity. It served as the birthplace of the Black theology, womanist theology, and 
                                other theological movements. Union houses the Columbia University Burke Library, one of the 
                                largest theological libraries in the Western Hemisphere.

                            <p align= 'justify'>The American Psychological Association (APA) is the world’s largest 
                                scientific and professional association of psychologists, with 90,000 members and 65,000
                                student and teacher affiliates, international affiliates, and associate members. The APA 
                                was founded on July 8, 1892, by a small group of psychologists meeting in Professor G. 
                                Stanley Hall’s study at Clark University. The thirty-one charter members, not all present 
                                at the founding meeting, were primarily scientific and academic psychologists. In the first 
                                few decades, rival associations were formed by psychologists who felt that their theoretical 
                                or professional orientations were not adequately represented in the APA. During World War II 
                                these differences were set aside and a national coordinating committee channeled the skills of 
                                the entire psychological community toward America’s war effort.
